## Introduction

This docuement outlines a structure that could be used for a Gator tutorial attached to the Gator user study.  This tutorial will be attached to the [website implementation](https://github.com/cucapra/gator-study/blob/master/implementation.md).  All writing here is highly preliminary and is just a potential structure for what the tutorial will eventually look like.

We will start by examining what information needs to be imparted the user, then look at a potential tutorial structure, and finally conclude with what shading models the user should be expected to write after finishing this tutorial.

## Information Overview

The goal of this tutorial is to write a simple fragment shader.  As such, the user should be taught the basics of the geometry needed to calculate light angles and keep track of reference frames, but should not include details about the graphics pipeline, TypeScript model, or vertex shader beyond what is needed.  It may be worthwhile and user-friendly to include an extended tutorial with such details, but that will be certainly omitted from the study itself.
