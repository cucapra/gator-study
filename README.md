Building a user study for Gator

I would recommend starting with [the website implementation document](https://github.com/cucapra/gator-study/blob/master/documentation/implementation.md) to get a sense of what we're building on the outline to get a sense of why we're building it.

## serving
We currently are using a python simple server to run our website on `localhost:8000`.

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
